# MtG_Ontology

The scope of this project consists on creating an ontology about the game Magic The Gathering, using the ontology editor Protégé, and generating a RDF file to be used in GraphDB. Then, after the file is correctly imported, it is possible to visualise the different relations between the previously defined individuals, in the form of a graph.
The second phase of this project consists on defining different SPARQL queries that search and filter the information presented in the previosuly mentioned RDF file. 

Finally, it was defined a web application, using Nodejs, that allows the analysis and visualisation of the defined SPARQL queries, using the module sparql-client-2.
The final report of this project is in portuguese and demonstrates the different implementation phases during the development of the application, with images that depict the use of the referred technologies. Also, the file MtGOntology.owl presents the created ontology and details the several defined classes and instances.
